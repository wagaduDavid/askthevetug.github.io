	<p>
Knowing your pet/animal's age is quite important as it helps zero down to specific diseases and physiological changes which may dictate a change in feeding or even breeding behaviors.
<br>
<br>
Knowing your animals age also quickens the diagnosis by the Vet and zeros down to few questions asked.
<br>
<br>
A number of ways have been devised to ease on age determination such as use of dentition or the teeth. So if u see the vet poking his eyes into the mouth of your animal, he isn't crazy. 
<br>
<br>
Sometimes he may be looking for signs of disease but age is also something. As they say "get it from the horse's mouth", lol. The quote wasnâ€™t required.
<br>
<br>
Take time and discover the age of your animal today and ensure to make proper records.
<br>
<br>
Stay safe, stay healthy
