		Recently, a case of Newcastle disease was reported and presented, and like any other preliminary veterinary tests, a thorough clinical examination history was obtained. History showed that she obtained the bird from the streets for breeding.
		<br>
		<br> 
		Unfortunately, all birds died and non were saved.
		<br>
		<br> 

Now Newcastle disease(NCD) is a viral disease and cannot be managed or cured which leaves a major loss to poultry farmers when affected due to high mortalities.
<br>
		<br>
Newcastle disease can be obtained via feeding or spread through air from infected birds. The signs it presents with are like any other respiratory and gastrointestinal poultry disease, greenish watery feces, dull feathers, body weakness, lack of activity and others.
<br>
		<br>
Now most subsistence farmers respond by getting antibiotics to treat anything like this, however, this is wrong since the disease is viral and antibiotics act against bacterial life. This becomes a waste of time, money and effort.
<br>
		<br>
The best way forward is vaccination to prevent it from affecting your birds, and emphasis on appropriate and professional vaccination since without proper knowledge, vaccines fail.
Another is purchase of birds from appropriate and trusted personnel.
<br>
		<br>
The pictures below show a sick bird in a battery cage on the street showing signs of sickness ready to be sold to someone. Another picture shows a group of highly congested birds which is a fertile ground for spreading a disease such as NCD among others.
<br>
		<br>
A person who purchases such a bird can visit your farm and bring the infection to your birds.
<br>
		<br>
Let's be alert, if you need proper vaccinations, contact a vet, don't do it yourself in a means to save money. This also concerns drug prescription and administration as it produces a risk of antibiotic/antimicrobial resistance which is a topic for another day.
<br>

Stay safe. #AsktheVet
